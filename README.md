# Hangman

My Hangman game. I am writing this for practice.

On 7/22/23 it can generate random words from a bank, ask for input from the user, and check if that imput is inside the chosen word. It gives the user 5 wrong tries, and breaks the cycle once that count is reached. It also checks if the user has guessed the full amount of letters in the word, and breaks the cycle.

Improvements to make:
Display dashes to stand for each letter in word and replace each dash when its corresponding letter is guessed.

Improve the correct guess count from just counting the amount of correct guesses and assuming they are all for diferent letters to comparing the letter to the word and marking off a letter, and tell the user that geuss has already been made.
